# Tic-Tac-Toe using ReactJS

Hello üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ! Welcome to my Tic-Tac-Toe game.
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic  game (also called Noughts and Crosses) of two players (X & O),who take turns marking the spaces in a 3√ó3 grid.
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner.
